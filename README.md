# hs_alkane
Fortran2003 code (with C and Python bindings) implementing hard-sphere alkane models as described in the following papers from
the Monson group at the University of Massachusetts.

This code was created for the work reported in [Bridgwater & Quigley, "Lattice-switching Monte Carlo method for crystals of flexible 
molecules", *Phys. Rev. E* 90, 063313 (2014)](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.90.063313). These are fun models to
play with so others users may find the code useful/interesting. No guarantee of fitness for any particular purpose is implied by 
that statement.
